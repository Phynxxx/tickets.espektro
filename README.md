# Espektro Tickets - Digital Ticketing Platform

This project is a modern, web-based ticketing platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to streamline and digitalize the entire event ticketing process.

## The Need for Digitalization

Traditional paper-based ticketing systems often suffer from inefficiencies, potential for fraud, and inconvenience for both organizers and attendees. Manual processes can lead to long queues, lost tickets, and difficulties in tracking attendance accurately. Espektro Tickets aims to solve these problems by providing a fully digital solution.

*   **Secure User Authentication:** Easy and secure login/signup process for attendees.
*   **Digital Ticket Purchase:** Seamless online ticket purchasing experience.
*   **QR Code Generation:** Each ticket is issued with a unique QR code for secure validation.
*   **Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Event Management: Create, update, and manage event details.
    *   Attendance Tracking: Real-time monitoring of attendee check-ins.
    *   QR Code Scanning: Integrated QR scanner for quick and reliable ticket validation at the venue entrance.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Benefits
